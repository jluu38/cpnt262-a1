## Summary

- *To preface*: skimmed too quickly over the Use Cases subsection of the assignment and didn't realise there were 4 options focused on toggling menus/configs/etc. Decided to barrel on anyways and thus --
- The button toggles:
  - Icons of the hands while throwing/catching the ball.
  - Position of the ball (on CSS Grid)
  - A so-called "night mode" that darkens the background image with a linear gradient (it's an eyesore -- sorry).
- Had some issues with using `querySelector` for some reason and relied more on `getElementById`.
- Font Awesome classes made HTML elements difficult to read (and navigate w/ Javascript) but found the `data-text-swap` solution to show the current state of toggle instead.
- Sorry for the mixup! However, I did play with classList toggle in my [CPNT201 - SVG Graphic](https://jluu38.github.io/cpnt201-a3/) assignment and managed a night mode there (not that I'm expecting you to mark that assignment in place of this one).
